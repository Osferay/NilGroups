Functions to work with infinite torsion-free nilpotent groups of small hirsch rank.

general.gi:   Offers some functions that are general for the other files.
exam.gi       Functions to generate some minimal T-groups.
series.gi     Functions to generate the isolator series of a T-group.
iso.gi        Functions to check if two T-groups are isomorphic (CURRENTLY NON WORIKING).
conjugacy.gi  WORKS FOR ALL NILPOTENT GROUPS. Functions to solve the following problems:
                - Centralizer problem.
                - Conjugacy problem.
                - Canonical conjugate. 
                - Normalizer problem.
                - Subgroup Conjugacy problem.
deprecated.gi Functions that are no longer used but can be recovered if necessary.
